The title of my app is OverPAaid: NBA and the link to my app is https://nba-app-vzqb.onrender.com.
The goal of my website is to compare an nba player's stats against the average stats of a player at their position.
The aim is to see of the player over or under performs with the given stats.
In order to get the data I had to scrape the website with python and then convert my data to a useable json file.
I created endpoint for the api for all the player stats and all the avg stats by position.
The steps to take for my app are to first register an account and if you already have one you can just log in
and from there you are propmted to the main apps page where you search for any nba player and also select their position to compare stats.
